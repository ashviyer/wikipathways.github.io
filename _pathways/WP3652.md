description: Ectodysplasin A protein regulation of hair follicle growth and differentiation
  through activation Nf-kB pathway occurring by binding of p65/p50 complex. The new
  protein complex of Nf-kB/p65/p50 activates Wnt and Bmp pathway inhibitors stopping
  induction/patterning. Nf-kB complex then binds with Ltb and Shh to activate pathways
  for growth and differentiation. This pathway is based on figure 4 from Cui et al.
