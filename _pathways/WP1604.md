  title: 'Identifying Drug-Induced Liver Injury Associated With Inflammation-Drug
    and Drug-Drug Interactions in Pharmacologic Treatments for COVID-19 by Bioinformatics
    and System Biology Analyses: The Role of Pregnane X Receptor (2022)'

description: The principal pathways for the metabolism of codeine occur in the liver,
  although some metabolism occurs in the intestine and brain. Approximately 50-70%
  of codeine is converted to codeine-6-glucuronide by UGT2B7. Codeine-6-glucuronide
  has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu-opioid receptor, coded for by the OPRM1
  gene. Approximately 10-15% of codeine is N-demethylated to norcodeine by CYP3A4.
  Norcodeine also has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu-opioid receptor. Between
  0-15% of codeine is O-demethylated to morphine, the most active metabolite, which
  has a 200 fold greater affinity for the mu-opioid receptor compared to codeine.
  This metabolic reaction is performed by CYP2D6.  Approximately 60% of morphine is
  glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) while 5-10% is glucuronidated to
  morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). These reactions are principally catalyzed by UGT2B7
  in the liver. UGT1A1 may have a minor role in the formation of M3G, and UGT1A1 and
  UGT1A8 are capable of catalyzing the formation of M6G in vitro and so contribute
  to this pathway, although UGT1A8 is minimally expressed in the liver and so is not
  depicted here. M6G has a higher affinity for OPRM1 than morphine and M3G and so
  the ratio of morphine to M6G is considered an important indicator of analgesic effect.  Transporters
  are also depicted in this pathway, as they influence the clearance of codeine, morphine,
  and their metabolites. Some of the evidence for the involvement of these transporters
  was derived from experiments done in mice and may or may not be translatable to
  human pharmacokinetics. The transporters present at the blood-brain barrier, not
  depicted in this pathway, as well as metabolic enzymes and transporters in the brain
  and GI tract, likely also play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of codeine
  and morphine.  A disease linked to this pathway is Gilbert syndrome (visualised
  in pink), which is characterized by impaired glucuronidation due to a polymorphism
  in the gene encoding UGT1A1.
