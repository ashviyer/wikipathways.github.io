description: 'Overview of the IDO metabolic pathway. Approximately 95% of L-tryptophan
  (Trp) is catabolized into kynurenine (Kyn) through three rate-limiting enzymes:
  tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1/2
  (IDO1/2) in peripheral tissues. Kyn is converted to 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) by
  kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), to anthranilic acid (AA) by kynureninase (KYNase),
  or to kynurenic acid (KYNA) by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT). Next, catalyzed
  by KYNase, 3-HK is converted to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), which is further
  converted to quinolinic acid (QA), picolinic acid, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD+), and other molecules.  Starting point: https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/figures/PMC6090955__13045_2018_644_Fig1_HTML.html'
