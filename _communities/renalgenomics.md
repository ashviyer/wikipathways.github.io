title: "Welcome to the Renal Genomics Community at WikiPathways"

description: "This page highlights WikiPathways content related to renal biology and disease. Most available pathways lack tissue/cell specificity and are of limited usefulness in highly differentiated organs such as the kidney. In order to produce quality renal genomics data, new and updated kidney-specific pathways are needed. This page offers an opportunity for renal physiologists to participate in creating, testing and curating new pathways, thereby contributing with modern methodology to integrate the renal knowledge-base."

contribute: "You are invited to test and curate existing pathways as well as to create new ones. All suggestions and contributions are welcome, contact Agustin Gonzalez-Vicente if interested in adding pathways. Suggested topics for new pathways are Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis type II, Acute Kidney Injury,, Chronic Kidney Disease, Diabetic Nephropathy, Kidney Transplants and Rejection, Mitochondria in Renal Disease, Membranous Nephropathy, Immune System and the Kidney, Renovascular Hypertension, Salt-Sensitive Hypertension. 

Some useful resources related to kidney biology are 

* [Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)](https://kpmp.org/): The KPMP actively engages academics, industry, and the broader scientific community as it works to deepen understanding of the kidneys.

* [Epithelial System Biology Laboratory(ESBL)](https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/): download data and access computational tools.

* [Kidney System Biology Project (ESBL)](https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/KSBP2/): renal epithelial transcriptome and proteome databases."
