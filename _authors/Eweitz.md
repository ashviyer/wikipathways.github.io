bio: I refine pathways, and engineer them into tools for biological discovery.

My contributions are mostly systematic graphical and data improvements.  Lately, I have created a number of new pathways, sourced directly from literature (https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/), and other pathway databases.  The quick and open (https://www.wikipathways.org/contribute.html) nature of WikiPathways is delightful.

I also incorporate pathways into Gene Leads Ideogram (https://eweitz.github.io/ideogram/gene-leads), a reuseable web component I've been developing to enrich gene search.
